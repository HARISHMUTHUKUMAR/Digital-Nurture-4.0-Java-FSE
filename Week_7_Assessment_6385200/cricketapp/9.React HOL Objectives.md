Objectives



**1) List the features of ES6.**



Block-scoped Variables: let and const allow variables with block scope, making code safer and easier to manage.



Arrow Functions: Shorter syntax for functions using =>, with different behavior for this binding.



Classes: Simpler way to create objects and deal with inheritance, similar to other Object Oriented Programming languages.



Template Literals: Backtick (`) strings with embedded expressions using ${}.



Default Parameters: Functions can have default values for parameters.



Destructuring: Quick assignment of variables from arrays or objects.



Enhanced Object Literals: Easier and shorter syntax to create objects.



Promises: Built-in support for handling asynchronous operations.



Modules: Built-in syntax for importing/exporting code between files.



Collections: New data structures like Map, Set, WeakMap, and WeakSet.





**2) Explain JavaScript let.**



The let keyword is used to declare variables that are limited in scope to the block, statement, or expression where they are defined. 

Unlike var, let does not hoist the variable to the top of the function or global scope and does not allow redeclaration in the same scope. 

This helps reduce bugs and confusion in code.





**3) Identify the differences between var and let.**



Scope: let is block-scoped; var is function-scoped.

In React, always use let (or const) to avoid unexpected bugs.



Hoisting: var is hoisted, let isn’t (can catch use-before-declaration errors).



Redeclaration: var can be redeclared, let cannot—this helps prevent accidental bugs.





**4) Explain JavaScript const.**



The const keyword declares variables that cannot be reassigned after their initial definition. 

Like let, it is block-scoped, but requires a value at the time of declaration. 

It’s great for values that should not change (constants), though the contents of arrays and objects assigned with const can still be modified (but not reassigned).





**5) Explain ES6 class fundamentals.**



class is used for class components before hooks.



jsx

class MyComponent extends React.Component {

&nbsp; constructor(props) { super(props); this.state = { count: 0 }; }

&nbsp; render() { return <div>{this.state.count}</div>; }

}



Contains a constructor, render method, and lifecycle methods (componentDidMount, etc.).





**6) Explain ES6 class inheritance.**



Class-based components inherit from React.Component.



jsx

class Parent extends React.Component { /\* ... \*/ }

class Child extends Parent { /\* ... \*/ }



Allows sharing/reusing logic, but function components with hooks are now preferred.





**7) Define  ES6 arrow functions.**



Arrow functions (() => {}) are widely used:



For defining components.



For event handlers (so this is bound correctly).



jsx

const handleClick = () => { console.log('Clicked!'); };

const Button = () => <button onClick={handleClick}>Click</button>;





**8) Identify set(), map().**



Set: Useful for state that needs unique values (e.g., multi-selection).



jsx

const \[selected, setSelected] = useState(new Set());

Map: Useful for storing key-value state (e.g., lookup tables).



jsx

const \[users, setUsers] = useState(new Map());

map() method (array): Used to render dynamic lists in JSX.



jsx

{items.map(item => <li key={item.id}>{item.name}</li>)}
