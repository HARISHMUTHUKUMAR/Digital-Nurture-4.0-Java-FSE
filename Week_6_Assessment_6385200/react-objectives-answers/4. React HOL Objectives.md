**1) Explain the need and Benefits of component life cycle.**



React components go through stages: mounting (added to the page), updating (when data changes), and unmounting (removed). 

Lifecycle methods let you run code at key moments to:

a) Fetch data (like in componentDidMount)

b) Manage resources (set up or clean timers, listeners)

c) Optimize performance (run costly tasks only when needed)

d) Handle errors gracefully

e) Control UI behavior smoothly







**2) Identify various life cycle hook methods.**



a) Mounting:



constructor — set up initial state

render — define what the UI looks like

componentDidMount — run after first render, good for data fetching



b) Updating:



shouldComponentUpdate — decide if UI needs re-rendering

componentDidUpdate — run after updates for further actions



c) Unmounting:



componentWillUnmount — clean up before removal



d) Error Handling:



componentDidCatch — catch errors in child components and show fallback UI or alerts









**3) List the sequence of steps in rendering a component.**



i) React initializes the component (constructor).

ii) Calls render to create the UI description.

iii) Updates the actual webpage (DOM).

iv) Calls componentDidMount for post-render tasks like fetching data.

v) On prop/state change, checks if update is needed (shouldComponentUpdate), then rerenders and calls componentDidUpdate.

vi) When removing, it calls componentWillUnmount to clean up.

vii) If errors happen during these phases, componentDidCatch handles them.
