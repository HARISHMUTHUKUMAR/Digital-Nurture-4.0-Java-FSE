**1. Explain React Components**

React components are the building blocks of React applications. 

They are reusable, self-contained pieces of UI that can accept input data (props) and return elements describing what should appear on the screen. 

Components help in breaking the UI into manageable parts, making code easier to maintain and reuse.





**2. Differences Between Components and JavaScript Functions**

Purpose:

React components are primarily designed to build and render user interfaces. 

JavaScript functions are general-purpose blocks of code used for computations, logic, or any other operations.



Return Value:

React components return JSX (a syntax that looks like HTML) or React elements that describe what should appear on the screen. 

JavaScript functions return ordinary data types such as strings, numbers, objects, or nothing at all.



Usage Context:

React components are used to create UI elements and handle the rendering of the user interface. 

JavaScript functions perform logic, calculations, data manipulation, or processing tasks that do not involve rendering UI directly.



State and Lifecycle:

React components can maintain their own internal state and have lifecycle methods/hooks to respond to component life events (like mounting, updating, unmounting). 

Regular JavaScript functions do not have state or lifecycle capabilities.



JSX Handling:

React components return JSX which integrates with React's virtual DOM and rendering system. 

Normal functions do not use or return JSX unless they are acting as components.





**3. Types of React Components**

Class Components: Defined using ES6 classes, extend React.Component. 

They can have internal state and lifecycle methods.



Function Components: Simple JavaScript functions that return JSX. 

They are often stateless but, with React Hooks, they can also manage state and side effects.



**4. Explain Class Component**

A class component is a React component defined as a class extending React.Component. It must contain a render() method that returns JSX, describing what should be rendered on the UI. Class components can manage their own internal state and lifecycle methods, like componentDidMount.



Example:



import React, { Component } from 'react';



class Greeting extends Component {

&nbsp; render() {

&nbsp;   return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}!</h1>;

&nbsp; }

}





**5. Explain Function Component**

A function component is a JavaScript function that accepts props as an argument and returns JSX. Since React 16.8, function components can also manage state and lifecycle using Hooks, making them equally powerful as class components.



Example:



jsx

function Greeting(props) {

&nbsp; return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;

}

Or using arrow function:



jsx

const Greeting = (props) => <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;





**6. Define Component Constructor**

The constructor is a special method in class components invoked when a component instance is created. It is used to initialize state and bind event handler methods.



Example:



jsx

class Counter extends React.Component {

&nbsp; constructor(props) {

&nbsp;   super(props);

&nbsp;   this.state = { count: 0 };

&nbsp; }

&nbsp; // ...

}

Note: In function components, there is no constructor. State and other features are managed using Hooks.





**7. Define render() Function**

The render() function is a required method in class components that returns the JSX representing the component’s UI. React calls this method to know what to display.



It should be a pure function — given the same props and state, it should always return the same UI output without side effects.
