**1) Define SPA and its benefits**

A Single-Page Application (SPA) is a web app that loads a single HTML page and dynamically updates content without refreshing the whole page. 

Benefits include faster interactions, smoother user experience, reduced bandwidth use, easier development, and cross-platform compatibility.





**2) Define React and identify its working**

React is a JavaScript library for building interactive UIs. It works by creating a Virtual DOM, a lightweight copy of the real DOM. 

React compares changes in the Virtual DOM and updates only the changed parts in the real DOM, making apps fast and efficient.





**3) Identify the differences between SPA and MPA**



SPA: Loads one page and updates content dynamically, offering a seamless and fast experience.



MPA (Multi-Page Application): Loads a new page with each navigation, causing full page reloads.



SPAs are faster and more interactive but can face SEO challenges. MPAs are better for SEO but slower and less smooth.



SPAs use less bandwidth; MPAs have more traditional page load behavior.





**4)** **Explain Pros \& Cons of Single-Page Application**

Pros: Fast, smooth UI, less data usage, easier to build rich apps.

Cons: Longer initial load, SEO can be tricky, browser history handling can be complex, debugging can be harder.





**5)** **Explain about React**

React is a component-based library that makes building complex user interfaces easier. 

It uses JSX to write code that looks like HTML inside JavaScript, supports one-way data binding, and lets developers manage state and lifecycle easily with hooks.





**6) Define Virtual DOM**

The Virtual DOM is a virtual copy of the real web page DOM. 

React updates this copy first and then efficiently applies only the necessary changes to the actual DOM, improving performance.





**7) Explain Features of React**



Virtual DOM for better rendering speed



Component-based architecture for reusable UI elements



JSX syntax for easy UI coding



One-way data flow for predictable app state



Declarative design for clear UI programming



Hooks for managing state and side effects in functional components



Scalability and flexibility for apps of all sizes
